         <p id="p30">In this book the main contents of the lectures which I gave at the University of Berlin during the winter semester 1906&#8211;07 are presented. My original intention was merely to put together in a connected account the results of my own investigations, begun ten years ago, on the theory of heat radiation; it soon became evident, however, that it was desirable to include also the foundation of this theory in the treatment, starting with Kirchhoff&#8217;s Law on emitting and absorbing power; and so I attempted to write a treatise which should also be capable of serving as an introduction to the study of the entire theory of radiant heat on a consistent thermodynamic basis. Accordingly the treatment starts from the simple known experimental laws of optics and advances, by gradual extension and by the addition of the results of electrodynamics and thermodynamics, to the problems of the spectral distribution of energy and of irreversibility. In doing this I have deviated frequently from the customary methods of treatment, wherever the matter presented or considerations regarding the form of presentation seemed to call for it, especially in deriving Kirchhoff&#8217;s laws, in calculating Maxwell&#8217;s radiation pressure, in deriving Wien&#8217;s displacement law, and in generalizing it for radiations of any spectral distribution of energy whatever.</p>

         <p id="p31">I have at the proper place introduced the results of my own investigations into the treatment. A list of these has been added at the end of the book to facilitate comparison and examination as regards special details.</p>

         <p id="p32">I wish, however, to emphasize here what has been stated more fully in the last paragraph of this book, namely, that the theory thus developed does not by any means claim to be perfect or complete, although I believe that it points out a possible way of accounting for the processes of radiant energy from the same point of view as for the processes of molecular motion.</p>
